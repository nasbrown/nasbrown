## Wassup!✊🏽

Welcome to the profile! Hope all of my rocket🚀 science-level code intrigues you. All my repositories were coded while completing 100 pushups, 100 pullups and 1000 squats for each one. I take pride in making sure my coding skills are **STRONG**💪🏽, efficient and simple because similar to the guy that said "I pick things up and put them down", in a coding sense "I build awesome things and deploy them even better".

But on a serious note,

I am passionate about building technology that can offset the rise of AI disrupting youth education as there may not be an incentive to learn when AI is easily accessible(can say that as I'm part of the last generation that remembers when no one had a mobile computer in their pocket and **played outside**)

In a sea of AI agents, Vibe coders and possibly AGI it's easy for people to spread negativity and spread doom snd this may cause the next generation to try less and feel helpless. I want to be the guy making sure that learning doesn't die and the spirits of those who may be drowninig in the negativity can see the upside of what's happening.

- Big anime fan: One Piece, Hunter X Hunter🙅🏾‍♂️ and Naruto in that order are my top 3
- Bigger NBA fan: Miami Heat fan since 06'
- Biggest fan of people who persevere throught the tough times and make things happen
